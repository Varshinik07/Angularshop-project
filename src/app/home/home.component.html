            <h3>Enlightenment Era</h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toys became more widespread with changing Western attitudes towards children and childhood brought about by the Enlightenment. 
  Previously, children had often been thought of as small adults, who were expected to work in order to produce the goods that the family 
  needed to survive. Hoops have long been a popular toy across a variety of cultures.
  As these ideas began changing during the Enlightenment Era, blowing bubbles from leftover washing up soap became a popular pastime,
   as shown in the painting The Soap Bubble (1739) by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, and other popular toys included hoops, toy wagons, 
   kites, spinning wheels and puppets. Many board games were produced by John Jefferys in the 1750s, including A Journey Through Europe.
    The game was very similar to modern board games.<br>
  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nineteenth century, Western values prioritized toys with an educational purpose, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games.
   Religion-themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes.
    With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, which led to the application of
     industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.<br>
  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More complex mechanical and optical-based toys were also invented during the nineteenth century. Carpenter and Westley began to 
  mass-produce the kaleidoscope, invented by Sir David Brewster in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items within three months in London 
  and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce magic lanterns for use in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, by developing a method 
  of mass production using a copper plate printing process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included royalty, flora and fauna,
   and geographical/man-made structures from around the world.

            <h4>Antiquity</h4>

Most children have been said[by whom?] to play with whatever they can find, such as sticks and rocks. 
Toys and games have been retrieved from the sites of ancient civilizations, and have been mentioned in ancient literature. 
Toys excavated from the Indus valley civilization (3010–1500 BCE) include small carts, whistles shaped like birds, and toy monkeys 
that could slide down a string.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest toys were made from natural materials, such as rocks, sticks, and clay. 
Thousands of years ago, Egyptian children played with dolls that had wigs and movable limbs, which were made from stone, pottery, and wood.
However, evidence of toys in ancient Egypt is exceptionally difficult to identify with certainty in the archaeological record. 
Small figurines and models found in tombs are usually interpreted as ritual objects; those from settlement sites are more easily labelled as toys.
These include spinning tops, balls of spring, and wooden models of animals with movable parts.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient Greece and ancient Rome, children played with dolls made of wax or terracotta: sticks, bows and arrows, and yo-yos. 
When Greek children, especially girls, came of age, it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of their childhood to the gods. 
On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest known mechanical puzzle also comes from ancient Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BCE. 
The game consisted of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from the pieces. 
In Iran, "puzzle-locks" were made as early as the 17th century (CE).
